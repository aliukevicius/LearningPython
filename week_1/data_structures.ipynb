    "\n",
    "If a tuple contains a mutable object, such as a list, that object remains mutable, even though it's inside an immutable object. This means you can change the content of the list, like adding, removing, or changing items, even though the list is inside a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are often used for groups of values that go together and will not change, such as coordinates on a graph, the RGB values of a color, or the date of birth of a person (year, month, day).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common use case for tuples is when you want to ensure that an item's value cannot change. For instance, if you want to make sure that a specific configuration setting doesn't get altered accidentally, you could store it in a tuple."
