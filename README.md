# ChatGPT provided learning plan

## Initial prompt

```
You are a professional Python teacher. Create me a 10 week python learning plan. The end goal is to be able to work with large language models. Make a detailed daily learning plan. Assume that I will be learning each week from Monday to Friday. We will be doing project based learning. Each day should have at least five mini projects that can be done to learn the needed material for that day.
